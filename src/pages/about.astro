              VillageFive is a YouTube channel dedicated to the disasters that history forgot. Every week, we publish a new documentary about a catastrophic event most people have never heard of: earthquakes that leveled cities, explosions that wiped towns off the map, floods that killed hundreds of thousands. The ones that never made it into a textbook.
            </p>
            <p>
              We dig into the research, the real accounts, and the details that got buried over time. No clickbait. No speculation. Just the stories, told straight.

              History has a short memory. The 1871 Peshtigo Fire killed more people than the Great Chicago Fire, but it happened on the same night and never got the headlines. The 1975 Banqiao Dam collapse killed over 200,000 people, but the Chinese government classified it for 20 years. The 1986 Lake Nyos disaster killed 1,746 people in their sleep, and most of the world still doesn't know it happened.

              These stories matter because they repeat. The same failures, the same warnings ignored, the same communities left to rebuild alone. Understanding what went wrong is the only way to make sure it doesn't happen again.

              New long-form disaster documentaries every week. Deep dives into single events, ranked lists of forgotten catastrophes, and short-form stories on YouTube Shorts. Every video is researched, scripted, and built to tell the full story, not just the headline.
            </p>
            <p>
              Topics range from natural disasters like earthquakes, floods, and wildfires to industrial accidents, structural failures, and cover-ups. If it was devastating and overlooked, we cover it.
